library-boilerplate
=========================

An opinionated setup for react libraries with CommonJS and UMD builds via Babel
and Webpack alongside ESLint with Jest and Enzyme for testing. A simple example
is included for reference.

Heavily based on the more generic library-boilerplate by [gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon)

If you use this, make sure to grep for “library-boilerplate” and replace every occurrence.
See `package.json` in the root and the example folder for the list of the available commands.

May or may not include the latest versions of all dependencies.

Notes
Designed to work with NPM 3, for information on Jest and NPM3 see [here](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/554)
